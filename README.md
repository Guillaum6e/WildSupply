# Simple MVC

## Description

This repository is a simple PHP MVC structure from scratch.
It uses some cool vendors/libraries such as Twig and Grumphp.

This project was made by a team of 5 including me, during our training with WildCodeSchool.
We had 3 weeks to come up with an idea and build it from nothing to finally show it in front of the whole school.
